🧠 Employee Attrition Prediction
Predicting employee turnover using data-driven machine learning techniques.

📋 Project Overview

Employee attrition — the rate at which employees leave a company — is a major challenge for organizations.
High attrition can lead to increased hiring costs, reduced productivity, and a negative impact on team morale.

This project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts whether an employee is likely to leave the company based on various HR-related factors such as job satisfaction, performance rating, work environment, and compensation.

By identifying potential attrition risks early, HR teams can take proactive retention measures and improve employee engagement.

🎯 Objectives

- Analyze HR data to understand key drivers of employee attrition.

- Build a predictive model that classifies employees as likely to stay or leave.

- Evaluate multiple ML algorithms to find the most effective one.

- Provide actionable insights using explainable AI (feature importance / SHAP analysis).
